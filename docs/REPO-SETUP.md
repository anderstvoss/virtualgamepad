# Maximally Hardened Public Rust Repo — Reusable Blueprint

End-to-end procedure for bootstrapping a single public GitHub repo
with the strongest free-tier hardening surface. Apply this file to
any new project that wants the same posture — copy it verbatim and
follow the checklists.

> **Why single-repo?** GitHub Free **public** repos unlock secret
> scanning, push protection, private vulnerability reporting,
> `actions/dependency-review-action`, OpenSSF Scorecard with token
> scope, branch protection / Repository Rulesets — all gated behind
> GHAS (paid) on private repos. Going public is the cheapest path to
> strong server-side controls. The split this repo used to maintain
> (a private working repo plus a public mirror) added complexity
> without adding security; the sync tooling was extracted to a
> separate toolkit reusable for projects that genuinely need an
> embargoed or sensitive parallel.

## Bootstrap

Run from inside a freshly-created public GitHub repo (cloned to your
machine).

### Step 1 — Drop in the committed files

Copy every file from the inventory above into the new repo.

Make hook scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit .githooks/pre-push scripts/deep-scan.sh
```

Verify the workflow + action SHAs match what this repo currently
ships — bumping pins is a deliberate, audited change.

### Step 2 — Local clone setup

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny cargo-audit
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# Remove any stale wrappers from a prior `pre-commit install`.
rm -f .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-push
```

`pre-commit` itself must be installed system-wide (via pipx or pip).
The committed wrappers in `.githooks/` invoke whichever `pre-commit`
is on `PATH`.

Verify:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath                            # → .githooks
ls .githooks/                                        # → pre-commit  pre-push
pre-commit run --all-files                           # all commit-stage hooks pass
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push     # cargo-deny + cargo-audit pass
```

### Step 3 — Enable server-side controls

```bash
REPO=<owner>/<repo>

# Secret scanning + push protection (free on public)
gh api --method PATCH /repos/$REPO --input - <<'EOF'
{"security_and_analysis":{"secret_scanning":{"status":"enabled"},"secret_scanning_push_protection":{"status":"enabled"}}}
EOF

# Private vulnerability reporting
gh api -X PUT /repos/$REPO/private-vulnerability-reporting

# Dependabot alerts + automated security updates
gh api -X PUT /repos/$REPO/vulnerability-alerts
gh api -X PUT /repos/$REPO/automated-security-fixes

# Branch protection
cat > /tmp/branch-protection.json <<'EOF'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": [
      "Rust lint",
      "Rust build and test (ubuntu-latest)",
      "Rust build and test (macos-latest)",
      "Rust build and test (windows-latest)",
      "Policy checks (ubuntu-latest)",
      "Policy checks (macos-latest)",
      "Policy checks (windows-latest)",
      "Supply chain audit"
    ]
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 0,
    "require_code_owner_reviews": false,
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": false
  },
  "restrictions": null,
  "required_linear_history": true,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false,
  "required_conversation_resolution": true
}
EOF
gh api -X PUT /repos/$REPO/branches/main/protection --input /tmp/branch-protection.json
```

For repos accepting community PRs, bump `required_approving_review_count`
to `1` and flip `require_code_owner_reviews` to `true`.

### Step 4 — First push

The pre-push hook will run gitleaks + tracked-file + local-paths
checks, then `cargo deny check` + `cargo audit`. All must pass before
the push is accepted.

Once pushed, CI runs the eight required-status contexts plus the
PR-only `dependency-review` job (when triggered by a PR).

### Step 5 — Verify

```bash
REPO=<owner>/<repo>

gh api /repos/$REPO | jq '.security_and_analysis'
# → secret_scanning + secret_scanning_push_protection both "enabled"

gh api /repos/$REPO/branches/main/protection | jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'
# → returns all eight contexts

gh pr create --draft --title "verify ci" --body "noop"
# → opens a PR running full 8-job CI + dep-review

gh workflow run scorecard.yml --repo $REPO
# → SARIF appears in Security tab within ~5 min

gh workflow run gitleaks-history.yml --repo $REPO
# → completes green
```

Sanity test: try pushing a fake AWS access key on a scratch branch.
GitHub push protection should reject it server-side.

## Local Developer Setup (one-liner reference)

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny cargo-audit
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
rm -f .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-push    # remove stale wrappers if any
```

Plus `pre-commit` itself installed system-wide:

```bash
pipx install pre-commit
# or:
pip install --user pre-commit
```

---

## Maintenance Notes

- **Dependabot updates** open PRs against `main`. Treat them like any
  other dep change: review the changelog, let CI run, merge.
- **Branch protection contexts must exactly match CI job names**
  (case-sensitive, including matrix expansion). If you add or rename
  a job, update the required-status-checks list via
  `gh api -X PUT .../branches/main/protection`.
- **The harden-runner allowlist** is a starter list. First real
  dependency that pulls from a new endpoint (e.g. a build-script
  fetching a vendored library) will fail with `blocked egress` — add
  the endpoint to the allowlist and re-run.
- **`required_linear_history`** on the public ruleset means PRs must
  be squashed or rebased — merge commits are blocked. Adjust if your
  workflow expects merge commits.
- **Deep scan before publish/merge.** Every-run hooks scan staged
  content and the current ref's history only; un-merged side branches
  and tags are covered weekly by `.github/workflows/gitleaks-history.yml`
  and ad-hoc by `scripts/deep-scan.sh`. Run the latter manually before
  any release tag.
- **Sensitive work fork.** If you ever need an embargoed parallel
  (security research, pre-disclosure fixes), the sync toolkit that
  used to live in this repo's `scripts/sync-*` is preserved as a
  separate private project (`repo-split-toolkit`). See its
  `docs/BOOTSTRAP.md` for the adoption recipe.
