# Six-gate acceptance on the current VM

Continue in PR #133 on its existing branch. Native timing and physical comparisons
remain post-alpha #135/#136. These six gates remain alpha requirements. Compilation
and short functional trials close only their stated cells. Keep historical failures
and raw artifacts outside tracked source.

## Input isolation prerequisite

`scripts/run-alpha-input-lab.py` defaults to a plan. Apply requires reviewed,
root-owned code and a hash-pinned test binary. The gated child drops privileges and
capabilities; client display/probe/library environment is applied only after that
drop. The parent installs a temporary rule for the child's exact creation-label
PID, assigns a separate `ID_SEAT` and `LIBINPUT_IGNORE_DEVICE=1`, verifies syntax
and reloads rules without triggering existing devices. Active Sony tests verify
input properties before touch injection and service required host probes while
waiting. Neutral scripts do not acquire this requirement.

The leader is observed with `WNOWAIT` and remains reserved through group/device
cleanup. Restoration refuses changed rule identity or remaining devices. A newly
created rule directory is removed only when empty. Regressions cover preparation
failure, timeout, interruption, gate EOF, repeated restoration and output quotas.
The installed scoped helper cannot replace its own root-owned code: administrator
installation is required. Preserve three fixed actions and no broad sudo.

## Acceptance cells and closure paths

| Gate | Work and evidence | Closure criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audio continuity | Compare C/Rust graph clocks, buffer handoff, channels, callback gaps and marker accounting. Prebuild and avoid competing tests. Correct demonstrated seams with regressions. | Three independent 60-second controls pass, then all 72 product trials and three-family slow-consumer/recovery checks pass without relaxed loss/duration assertions. |
| Provider recovery | Stage exact broker/worker hashes; preserve idle guards, original services and the global lock. Test successful attachment, worker/client death, bounds, pending-journal restart and identity-matched cleanup. | Bounded completion and owned cleanup, or truthful fail-closed rejection with tested operator restoration. Empty restart alone is insufficient. |
| Contacts/outputs | Prove PID isolation first. Exercise Sony HID and associated evdev nodes, both contacts/release, frames, feedback, partial construction, siblings and removal. | Exact observations and cleanup for representable controls/outputs. No contacts reach the shared desktop. Gamepad-only evdev results do not prove companion touch. |
| USB/IP audio/routing | Prepare attachment-identity-bound `ACP_IGNORE` before attach; verify the shared ALSA monitor ignores the lab card and shared defaults stay unchanged. Use direct ALSA/private graph access. | Supported three-family directions, routing transitions, disappearance/reconnect and teardown pass without touching foreign cards/routes/ports/journals. |
| Keyboard/accessibility | Owned display/state; keyboard traversal/activation, viewport selection, lockout, discovery loading/error/retry and output/error display. Regress demonstrated defects. | Interactive receipts plus regressions and owned cleanup. Neutral soak remains separate evidence. |
| Isolated Steam | Fresh data/config/state and display; inspect launcher's storage behavior first. Never copy/modify the real profile. Any login occurs in the disposable session. | Exact-candidate recognition and available input/output pass, with profile/device/process cleanup. No unspecified game compatibility claim. |

## Progress and final checks

The input runner and active-contact gate are committed with Python/Rust regressions.
Administrator installation and live isolation are pending. No active contacts were
injected by this continuation. Audio qualification remains failed; other cells stay
open until their receipts pass. This plan is not an acceptance result.

Run the five required Rust/Gitleaks checks, forced Rust 1.85, strict rustdoc/API/
inventory, Python/corpus/dependency/worker validators, root feature consumers and
exact-Git/offline rebuild. Verify final-head platform/security workflows and 17 SBOM
identities. Keep the PR draft until all six gates have supported dispositions.
Commit validated increments without rewriting history and retain exact revision,
tree, binary and lockfile receipts.

## Sequential continuation: keyboard touch

The touch canvas now supports focused Space activation/release and bounded WASD
movement. Hold retains a contact; a new Space press toggles it off. Relative movement
uses the existing composition path. Focus loss and selection changes release only
the keyboard-owned momentary contact. Reset/lockout suppression requires key release
before rearming. The canvas has a descriptive label, visible focus and keyboard hint;
the lockout checkbox itself is labelled.

Five new regressions cover exact quick-press/release events, focus loss, held sibling
preservation, relative edge clamping, reset/removal, selection and suppression, and
actual egui Space/D events beside an adjacent focus target. All 14 touch tests pass.
The five mandatory workspace commands passed before this documentation increment.
No dependencies were added. This is deterministic evidence, not completion of the
interactive keyboard inventory or the final two-hour soak. Gate 1 remains open;
the new GUI image requires a fresh soak. Gates 2–6 retain their previous dispositions.

## Session-aware USB serial prerequisite

The supporting `Profile::for_session` constructor validates a broker instance
(lowercase ASCII letters/digits/hyphens, 1–32 bytes) and a nonzero generation, then
compiles serial `vg-{instance}-{generation:016x}` at string index 3. `Profile::new`
retains its static descriptor and rejects index 3. The ordinary root API is unchanged.

Supporting worker `Setup` and broker `Launch` now require an owned `instance` field
and implement Clone rather than Copy. The installed worker launch ABI now has eight
arguments: PROFILE DEVICE GENERATION IDENTITY INSTANCE CONTROL_FD PLAYBACK_FD
MICROPHONE_FD. Broker and worker must be staged together; older installed images are
not evidence for this candidate. Broker configuration supplies the instance; IPC
clients cannot choose it. Invalid identities reject before readiness/worker launch,
and invalid worker setup closes all four owned channels.

Exact string/control regressions cover all three profiles, descriptor index,
truncation, language, unknown strings and static rejection. Production-worker
validation covers the exact serial on both FD layouts for all three families,
bidirectional synthetic PCM, diagnostics and closure. The new pure isolation-rule
builder uses two udev stages to combine USB serial with platform VHCI ancestry;
rule-injection regressions and `udevadm verify` pass. **The rule is not yet installed
or integrated into positive preparation.** It must precede attachment, and shared
PipeWire defaults/monitor exclusion still require live receipts. The shared-profile
off fallback is not an acceptable closure path.

The scoped administrator snapshot remains unchanged. No positive attachment,
shared routing change, audio qualification or Steam launch was performed in this
increment. The complete named-phase lab package and its preparation/restoration
regressions remain required before requesting administrator installation.

Keyboard touch now also has an actual Tab traversal regression proving that the
adjacent control receives focus and exactly one momentary release is generated.
Gate 1 still requires its complete control inventory, owned-display checks and a
fresh final-image soak. Gates 2–6 remain open; alpha is not ready and PR #133 stays
draft. Physical comparison/native timing remain separate post-alpha #136/#135.

## Motion keyboard lifecycle follow-up

Motion sliders previously completed momentary input only on pointer click/drag
release. Arrow-key release and focus loss now also neutralize motion when Hold is
off; Hold retains the value. A real egui slider regression demonstrates that the
old pointer-only predicate misses key release, and checks actual press/release,
focus surrender and Hold behavior. Previous-frame focus is retained because the
normal egui focus-loss edge can disappear before the next draw after containing
view focus surrender. The same completion helper is used for gyro and accel axes.
This correction does not close the full interactive inventory or soak gate.

## Reboot-aware continuation and bounded acceptance tooling

The VM restarted before the previous GUI soak produced a final receipt. That run
is interrupted, not accepted. A maintained neutral soak runner now records the
boot ID, frozen executable hash, persistent samples and final cleanup; its owned
unit has a 1 GiB memory ceiling and checks global available memory and pressure.
Its 60-second smoke completed with clean teardown and a 243 MiB cgroup peak. A new
7200-second trial is running; it is not accepted until its final receipt and
resource trend have been inspected. Raw receipts remain outside tracked source.

The C independent audio control now assigns a unique stereo block/phase marker to
each measured frame. A regression demonstrates that a missing frame and duplicate
within an old 128-frame block could otherwise cancel in totals. Qualification
requires zero missing, duplicated, corrupt or reordered frames and a complete
bounded event ledger. This corrects a harness blind spot; it does not resolve the
historical 4608-frame graph loss or qualify the VM. No new product continuity
claim is made. Ledger exports happen after teardown, not in realtime callbacks.

Positive provider probes now cover four-session admission exhaustion, sibling
removal and fresh-generation capacity recovery, verified client exit, worker death
and broker death. Root fault injection pins process identity with pidfds, verifies
worker privileges/image/cgroup and journal identity, and rejects stale startup
before clearing only an authoritative matching owned record. Candidate unit
identity is checked before stopping it. Synthetic regressions cover changed
identities, partial construction, combined initiating/cleanup errors and repeated
restoration. These phases have not been installed or run against live attachments.
The old scoped helper remains incompatible with the session-aware serial ABI.

The maintained Steam runner hides the real account home, uses a private bus,
disposable public rootfs and disk-backed private home/tmp, and caps its owned unit
at 2 GiB. Memory guards interrupted earlier bounded bootstrap attempts; retaining
RAM-backed rootfs data was demonstrated in these new attempts, not established as
the cause of the earlier VM reboot. The latest attempt reached the actual Steam
setup window and timed out at 120 seconds, with complete owned cleanup. There is
no login, controller-recognition or Steam acceptance receipt yet. Rootfs extraction
streams regular files, drops their cache and confines archive links to the guest.
No user profile or credentials are copied.

Current checkpoint: 232 Python tooling tests pass; the five required workspace
commands passed before the final Python-only additions and need final-candidate
receipts. No dependencies added. Gates 1–6 remain open, PR #133 stays draft, and
alpha remains not ready. Reviewers must distinguish deterministic supervisor tests,
bounded bootstrap/smoke evidence and live product acceptance. Next interventions
must install one complete immutable named-phase package, not grant broad sudo.

### Immutable provider package follow-up

`package-alpha-provider-lab.py` prepares all eight maintained provider/short USB
phases together from a clean committed source tree. Its default only prints a
plan. The generated administrator installer authenticates all payloads, checks the
existing three-action sudo scope, preserves the old exact helper/policy and rolls
back both atomically on validation failure. The installed run selector accepts
only predefined phase names, never commands, paths, environment or identities.
Client and candidate service units now have hard memory limits. Package tests cover
root/repeated identities, explicit port allowlists, symlinks/FIFOs, tampered hashes,
broad old policies and failed post-install validation restoration. All 238 Python
tests pass. Packaging/installation does not run trials or change services.

This package provides positive provider and short USB functional acceptance, not
complete Steam/controller-output or sustained audio acceptance. Those remain
separate gates. Unrepresentable gadget paths still require explicit rejection.
The new GUI soak is running under the frozen accepted-smoke image; it must not be
restarted on an observation timeout. Its persistent boot/PID/hash record is the
reference until process completion or a verified reboot.

### Direct HID output evidence

`crates/gr-curated-controllers/tests/hid_outputs_live.rs` adds individually opt-in
ordinary-client tests using only process/family/instance-selected hidraw nodes.
No touch, motion or PCM is injected. Each scenario services production controllers,
checks exact host observations, rejects output replay during idle service, closes
twice and verifies that its own HID node disappeared. Live trials use bounded
ordinary-user units with a 256 MiB memory ceiling and 20-second deadline.

| Family / HID output boundary | New exact live evidence | Remaining scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DualSense | Four audio-path values, independent mic mute/indicator, speaker/mic/preamp levels, player/RGB indicators, both 11-byte trigger fields, rumble start/update/zero stop and callback ordering | Raw effects and host route observations do not establish physical actuation or PCM routing; evdev/USB parity remains separate |
| DS4 | Rumble start/update/zero stop, RGB validity enabled/disabled and raw retention | Evdev/USB output parity and compound-node failure/isolation scenarios remain separate |
| Switch Pro | Exact motor words on reports 0x10/0x01, player command observation and success reply; USB handshake commands 1–6 with exact 64-byte replies | Encoded words do not establish decoded physical amplitude/frequency or player LED actuation; other report/protocol cells remain separate |
| Xbox 360 standard HID | Existing deterministic surface test explicitly declares no HID output capability | Conventional rumble belongs to evdev; no XInput/xpad or HID rumble claim |

The four named live scenarios passed separately, including owned cleanup. Two
deterministic tests cover exact ownership selection and malformed/truncated reply
rejection. Normal workspace testing leaves the four live tests ignored; run each
by its exact name with `VIRTUALGAMEPAD_OUTPUT_LAB=1`, `--ignored --exact`, a bounded
owned unit and prepared ordinary-user creation/hidraw access. Never blanket-enable
ignored tests. These receipts advance gate 2, not all-realization acceptance.

The administrator package already prepared for 247e6fc remains the compatible
provider/worker candidate: this increment only adds tests and documentation, with
no library behavior or supporting ABI change. Do not claim newer exact-source
provider acceptance from that installed package without final-candidate receipts.
